Manage change logs and release notes for your software project.

# Common Tasks

Once you have a change log file, you'll probably want to **validate** and **format**
it: make sure it's in good shape before publishing.

If you don't have a change log, you might want to **initialize** one.

While you're working on developing the next release, you probably want to
**record** some changes in the `preRelease`.

Once you're ready for a release, you'll want to **prep** the release to move your
changes from `preRelease` to a new `release` and determine an appropriate version number
for the release.
